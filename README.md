# PyTorch Language Modeling
A series of notebooks implementing key papers and architectures for neural language modeling. Don't hesitate to contact me if you find any bugs in the code!

### Requirements
PyTorch 1.0 and TorchText 0.3

### Contents
* 01 - Basic Neural Language Models
* 02 - Regularized and Variational RNNs
* 03 - Weight-tied LSTMs
* 04 - Recurrent Highway Networks
* 05 - AWD-LSTMs
* 06 - Transformer Architectures for Language Modeling

### Changelogs
This repository is a work in progress and I will make notebooks available as early as I can, so be sure to check back often!
* 04/20/19 -- Added Recurrent Highway Networks
* 04/21/19 -- Added rewritten version of Weight-Tied LSTMs. Switched to WikiText-2 on post-2014 papers. Will upload the other notebooks as soon as I finish rewriting.
